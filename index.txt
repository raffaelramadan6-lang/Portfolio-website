About Me
I’m a 28-year-old London-based IT enthusiast with a passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving. When I’m not working on tech projects, you’ll usually find me watching or playing football, diving into movies, or creating YouTube content in my spare time. I enjoy combining my technical skills with creativity, whether that’s through digital projects, video production, or exploring new ideas online.
